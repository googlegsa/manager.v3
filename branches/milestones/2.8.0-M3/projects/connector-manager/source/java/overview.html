<p>Defines the interface and support classes for connector developers
who wish to write plug-ins to the Google Search Appliance.</p>

<p>All connectors written to this interface should be housed in an
instance of the Connector Manager. The Connector Manager is java
software intended to run in a servlet container such as Tomcat. An
instance of the Connector Manager will be present (as of a future
version number as yet undecided) by default on-board all Search
Appliances-we call this the "internal" Connector Manager. In addition,
the Google Search Appliance (as of that same version) will have the
ability to interact with one or more Connector Managers installed
outside the box-"external" connector managers.</p>
<p>In principle, any connector that correctly implements this
interface could be run in either an internal or external Connector
Manager. However, Google has no present plan to permit 3rd-parties to
upload connectors to an internal Connector Manager. Only connectors
written and fully supported by Google can be run on-board. Thus,
third-party developers should assume that their connectors will run in
an external connector manager.</p>
<p>The Connector Manager is an open-source project sponsored by
Google. The project is hosted at <a
	href="http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/">
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/</a>. See that
web-site for further documentation and information.</p>
