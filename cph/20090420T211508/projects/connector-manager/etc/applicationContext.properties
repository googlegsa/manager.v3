# Google Enterprise Connector Manager Configuration

# The 'gsa.feed.host' property specifies the host IP address for the
# feed host on the GSA.
# For example:
#   gsa.feed.host=172.24.2.0
gsa.feed.host=localhost

# The 'gsa.feed.port' property specifies the host port for the feed
# host on the GSA.
# For example:
#   gsa.feed.port=19900
gsa.feed.port=19900

# The 'manager.locked' property is used to lock out the Admin Servlet
# and prevent it from making changes to this configuration file.
# Specifically, the ability to set the FeedConnection properties will
# be locked out.  If it is set to 'true' or missing the Servlet will
# not be allowed to update this file.
# NOTE: This property will automatically be changed to 'true' upon
# successful update of the file by the Servlet.  Therefore, once the
# FeedConnection properties are successfully updated by the Servlet
# subsequent updates will be locked out until the flag is manually
# reset to 'false'.
manager.locked=false

# The 'feedLoggingLevel' property controls the logging of the feed
# record to a log file.  The log record will contain the feed XML
# without the content data.  Set this property to 'ALL' to enable feed
# logging, 'OFF' to disable.  Customers and developers can use this
# functionality to observe the feed record and metadata information
# the connector manager sends to the GSA.
# For example:
#   feedLoggingLevel=OFF
feedLoggingLevel=OFF

# If you set the 'teedFeedFile' property to the name of an existing
# file, whenever the connector manager feeds content to the GSA, it
# will write a duplicate copy of the feed XML to the file specified by
# the teedFeedFile property.  GSA customers and third-party developers
# can use this functionality to observe the content the connector
# manager sends to the GSA and reproduce any issue which may arise.
# NOTE: The teedFeedFile will contain all feed data sent to the GSA,
# including document content and metadata.  The teedFeedFile can
# therefore grow quite large very quickly.
# For example:
#   teedFeedFile=/tmp/CMTeedFeedFile
# teedFeedFile=
