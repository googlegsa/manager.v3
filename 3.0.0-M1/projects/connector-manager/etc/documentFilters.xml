  <!-- A document filter acts to transform the information retrieved from
       its source document.  Typically document filters would add, remove,
       or modify a document's properties, including the document content.
       A document filter might even throw SkippedDocumentException to prevent
       a document from being fed to the GSA.

       DocumentFilterChain constructs a series of document filters. The filters
       are constructed from a list of DocumentFilterFactory beans, and linked
       together like pop-beads, each using the previous as its source document.
