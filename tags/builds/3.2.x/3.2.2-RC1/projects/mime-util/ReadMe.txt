This is the mime-util mime type detection utility from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mime-util/

The utility had an outdated mime-types.properties file,
so this vendor branch patches that.

The source directory contains the exploded contents of
the mime-util jar file, classes and resources.

To build, run ant on the build.xml file in this directory.
The new mime-util.jar file will be placed in dest.
