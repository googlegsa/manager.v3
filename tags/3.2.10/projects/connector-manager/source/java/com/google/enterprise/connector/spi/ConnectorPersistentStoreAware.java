/**
 * If a {@link Connector} implements this marker interface, then the Connector
 * Manager will call the setter when it instantiates it, supplying a
 * {@link ConnectorPersistentStore} object, which encapsulates how a connector
 * can persist and use information about documents or any other information.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> The Connector Manager calls {@code setDatabaseAccess}
 * after the Connector has been instantiated by Spring, but before calling
 * {@link Connector#login()}.  If the {@link Connector} bean configuration
 * specifies {@code dependency-check="all"} or if {@code setDatabaseAccess}
 * has been annotated {@code @Required}, the bean configuration must
 * specify a default value, such as {@code <null/>}, to satisfy the dependency
 * during bean construction.
