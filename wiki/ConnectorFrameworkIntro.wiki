= Introduction =

The *Google Connector Framework (GCF)*  is an open-source Java framework that enables
Google search appliances to present content stored in various popular *Enterprise Content
Management (ECM)* systems. 

Although Google is providing the first release of this framework, it's important to note
that Google does not officially provide technical support for the Connector Framework; as
with any other open-source project, technical support, bug fixes, and new features for
this framework come from your fellow members of the open-source community.

Please note also that this version of the Connector Framework does not yet provide full
functionality. Rather, it provides an early peek at this project for those who wish to get
an early start on the design and development of their own connectors. Google urges you to
return to this site regularly for updates to the connector framework source code and its
documentation.

Framework (GCF)</span>  enables Google search appliances to work with content stored in
various popular Enterprise Content Management systems. An <span
style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Enterprise Content Management (ECM)</span>  system provides a
central repository for large numbers of documents; it is not uncommon for such systems to
manage ten million documents. While all ECM systems provide some ability to retrieve
documents based on associated keywords or other metadata, this functionality is extremely
limited and slow in comparison to the powerful, flexible search capabilities that Google
search appliances provide.<br/>  <br/>  Many ECM systems provide an API that enables the
programmatic manipulation of documents. You can use the Connector Framework to create your
own Java connector that calls the native API of a specific ECM system on behalf of Google
search appliances. Multiple connector instances enable a search appliance to interact with
multiple ECM systems.<br/>  <br/>  Most ECM systems authenticate users, control access to
documents, and provide version-management functionality. Each connector enables a Google
search appliance to provide customized, optimized, automatic interaction with the
authentication and authorization features of a specific ECM system in order to:<span

style="MARGIN-LEFT:40px">  <ul>  <li>  Customize search results according to the access

documents from the ECM repository when the user clicks links in the search results<br/> 
</li>  <li>  Provide a single-sign-on experience that allows users to log into the search
appliance and the ECM system only once per day, rather than every time the user issues a
query or clicks a link in search results </li>  </ul>  <br/>  </div>  Many ECM systems
provide a means of signalling users when documents are added, deleted, or changed. Your
Java connector can use events generated by the ECM system to keep its index of crawled
documents up-to-date. However, the Connector Framework does not require the ECM system to
generate events. If the file paths that the Google search appliance uses to crawl the
document repository are not suitable for direct access to the document by users, your
connector can represent them differently in search results.<br/>  <br/>  The Google
Connector Framework (GCF) introduces one new significant public component, the <span
style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Connector Manager</span>. This service is responsible for hosting
and running connectors built with this framework. It also manages all communications
between Google search appliances and connectors. To manage your connectors, you'll run an
instance of the Connector Manager on any application server that provides a servlet
interface, such as Apache Tomcat. &nbsp; <div style="MARGIN-LEFT:40px">  <br/>  </div>
