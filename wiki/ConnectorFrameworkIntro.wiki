Although Google is providing the first release of this framework, it's important to note
that Google does not officially provide technical support for the Connector Framework; as
with any other open-source project, technical support, bug fixes, and new features for
this framework come from your fellow members of the open-source community.

Please note also that this version of the Connector Framework does not yet provide full
functionality. Rather, it provides an early peek at this project for those who wish to get
an early start on the design and development of their own connectors. Google urges you to

  Connector Framework Technical Introduction
Draft 1.0a2
Revised 18 Dec 2006 (jwp)

The Google Connector Framework (GCF) enables Google search appliances to work with content
stored in various popular Enterprise Content Management systems. An Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) system provides a central repository for large numbers of documents; it
is not uncommon for such systems to manage ten million documents. While all ECM systems
provide some ability to retrieve documents based on associated keywords or other metadata,
this functionality is extremely limited and slow in comparison to the powerful, flexible
search capabilities that Google search appliances provide.

Many ECM systems provide an API that enables the programmatic manipulation of documents.
You can use the Connector Framework to create your own Java connector that calls the
native API of a specific ECM system on behalf of Google search appliances. Multiple
connector instances enable a search appliance to interact with multiple ECM systems.

Most ECM systems authenticate users, control access to documents, and provide
version-management functionality. Each connector enables a Google search appliance to
provide customized, optimized, automatic interaction with the authentication and
authorization features of a specific ECM system in order to:

    * Build and update the index of searchable documents

    * Customize search results according to the access privileges of the user that issued
the search query

    * Serve documents from the ECM repository when the user clicks links in the search results
    * Provide a single-sign-on experience that allows users to log into the search
appliance and the ECM system only once per day, rather than every time the user issues a
query or clicks a link in search results


Many ECM systems provide a means of signalling users when documents are added, deleted, or
changed. Your Java connector can use events generated by the ECM system to keep its index
of crawled documents up-to-date. However, the Connector Framework does not require the ECM
system to generate events. If the file paths that the Google search appliance uses to
crawl the document repository are not suitable for direct access to the document by users,
your connector can represent them differently in search results.

The Google Connector Framework (GCF) introduces one new significant public component, the
Connector Manager. This service is responsible for hosting and running connectors built
with this framework. It also manages all communications between Google search appliances
and connectors. To manage your connectors, you'll run an instance of the Connector Manager
on any application server that provides a servlet interface, such as Apache Tomcat.  

The Google Connector Framework (GCF) also provides:

    * A simple and consistent graphical user interface (GUI) for administration of connectors.

The Administration console of the Google search appliance provides a graphical user
interface for configuring and managing connectors. Using the Connector Framework, you can
customize and extend this interface to accommodate specific features of your own connectors.

    * Programmatic configuration of connectors by means of Spring-compliant XML files.

For ease of installation, you can use a Spring file to

    * Automate the configuration of all connector settings
    * Configure optional features that do not lend themselves well to representation in a
graphical interface
    * Specify configuration details not visible to the connector, such as the hostname of
the machine on which its Connector Manager instance runs

    * Common scheduling and reporting that is customizable for each connector instance.

The GSA console provides centralized scheduling and reporting for all installed
connectors, and you can configure individual connectors to augment or supersede these
settings. You can customize your connector's crawling, feeding, authentication, and
authorization behavior for optimum interaction with a specific ECM system. Additionally,
you can configure each individual connector instance for optimum support of
installation-specific parameters, such as the maximum number of requests it may send to a
particular document repository in a specified time period.

    * Open source code

Google uses the Apache 2 license to make the Connector Framework source code open.
Google's goals in making the project open-source are:

    * To encourage and facilitate the development of connectors and other custom code for
the GSA

    * To provide the ultimately authoritative documentation of system behavior: source code.
    * To allow developers to debug with the aid of full view of the source
    * To open the architecture and development of the framework as a cooperative project
    * To give developers freedom to fix bugs in the framework
    * To enable developers to add significant new features easily
    * To encourage the free exchange of features, fixes, and other ideas within the
developer community
