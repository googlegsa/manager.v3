#summary Start here to explore the Connector Manager wiki!

= Introduction =

Welcome to the Google Enterprise Connector Manager project wiki!

The Connector Manager is the central part of the connector framework for Google search appliances.  The Connector Manager itself is a server that manages creation, instantiation, scheduling and monitoring of connector plug-ins that supply content and provide authentication and authorization services to the Google Search Appliance.

Some important disclaimers:
  * This system depends on a future version of the Google Search Appliance. 
  * The release date for this version is not yet determined. 
  * Plug-ins developed for this framework will NOT work with currently released Google Search Appliances!
  * Google makes NO commitments at this time to support the APIs in this project.
  * The documentation in this wiki is informal and unsupported.  When and if this project becomes formally supported, supported documentation will also be made available.  

This wiki is maintained by the development team itself.
