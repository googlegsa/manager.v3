**Reporting Issues with the Google Search Appliance Connector Manager**

For customers who qualify for enterprise-level support, Google
provides support for the Google Search Appliance Connectors. You can
go to [Google for Work support information](http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/go/gsa_support)
for instructions on how to contact Google for Work Support.

For unsupported issues, such as using the connectors without a Google Search
Appliance, working with the source code, or to report problems with
unsupported development builds, you can [file an issue](http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/list) on this code site.
Google may not respond to every issue.
