/**
 * Traditional Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC).  The interface is similar
 * to the MDC class  presented by the widely-used log4j.
 *
 * <p>The MDC class is similar to the {@link NDC} class except that it is
 * based on a Map instead of a Stack.  The MDC is managed on a per thread basis.
 * The Map contains key/value pairs that might be useful for distinguishing
 * different threads running similar tasks.  The {@link LayoutPattern} class
 * can insert the value associeated with specified keys as it generates its
 * log messages.
 *
 * <p>A thread may assign an MDC mapping using {@link #put(String,String)},
 * and retrieve the value associated with a key in the map by calling
 * {@link #get(String)}.  An individual key/value association may be removed
 * from the MDC by calling {@link #remove(String)}.
 *
 * <p>the entire contents of the map may be cleared by calling {@link #clear}.
 * This discards any key/value associations in the map, but retains the
 * ThreadLocal used to maintain the map.  This is useful if the thread will
 * be reused in the future, and desire diagnostic context.  For instance,
 * threads in a thread-pool handling servlet requests could create a new
 * context when a thread is taken from the pool and given a request
 * packet.  The context item  could uniquely identify the request
 * by requestor, port, cookie, etc.  Once the request has been
 * serviced, the thread could clear the MDC map just before being
 * returned to the thread-pool.
 *
 * <p>When a thread will be unlikely to use a diagnostic context in
 * the future, it should call {@link #remove()} to release the ThreadLocal
 * resources used by the context.  This is especially important if
 * when the thread exits, so these resources may get garbage collected.
 *
 * <p>A child thread automatically inherits a <em>copy</em> of the mapped
 * diagnostic context of its parent.
