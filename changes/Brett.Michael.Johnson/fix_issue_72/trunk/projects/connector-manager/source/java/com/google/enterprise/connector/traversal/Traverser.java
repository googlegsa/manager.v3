   * loop running a traversal method would call runBatch(), then check for
   * InterruptedException, then decide whether it wants to stop of itself, for
   * scheduling reasons, or for a clean shutdown. It could then re-adjust the
   * batch hint if desired, then repeat.

   * @param  batchHint A positive integer. This requests that the traversal
   *         method process no more than that number of documents in this batch.
   *
   * @return The actual number of documents given to the feed (may not be the
   *         same as the batch hint), with 0 and -1 having special meaning:
   *         A return value of -1 indicates that no new documents are available
   *         to index at this time - wait a while and try again.
   *         A return value of 0 indicates that while no documents were indexed
   *         in this batch, there are still potential candidates to consider.
   *         (Perhaps no documents passed in this batch because there were
   *         document errors or qualified documents are sparsely distributed in
   *         the repository).  Try another batch as soon as possible.
   *         A return value greater than 0 represents the actual number of
   *         douments traversed and pushed into the feed.  There are likely
   *         more documents available for traversal, so try another batch as
   *         soon as possible.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if a non-positive batchHint is supplied.
   *
   * TODO: Perhaps we should return a more complicated structure that allows
   *       for more interesting monitoring: number of successful docs,
   *       number failed, average size, etc.
