 * (side-effecting) calls throw UnsupportedOperation exceptions. These are
 * grouped at the bottom of the class implementation.
 * <li> Some level 1 calls are not implemented because they will never be used
 * by our connector infrastructure. Eventually, these will be documented as part
 * of framework documentation. In this implementation, they also throw
 * UnsupportedOperation exceptions. These are grouped above the level 2 calls.
 * <li> Some level 1 calls are not currently needed by our implementation, but
 * may be soon. These are marked with todos and throw UnsupportedOperation
 * exceptions.
