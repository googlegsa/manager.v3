Release 2.0.2,  02 Sept 2009
============================

Introduction
------------
This is a patch release that addresses performance issues and
fixes several small problems discovered in the previous release.
Users of previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.


Summary of Changes
------------------
  * Issue 162: Fixed a NullPointerException in logging XmlFormatter.
    This fix now allows use of the XmlFormatter without requiring a
    format to be specified.

  * Fixed a NullPointerException in context logging on shutdown.

  * Issue 106: Added support for feeding multiple documents to the GSA
    in a single feed file.  Previously, the Connector Manager would create
    a new feed file for each Document.  This was inefficient and could
    result in slow feed performance.  The Connector Manager will now
    accumulate feed data into a single feed per connector traversal.
    Once that feed exceeds a set size or when the traversal batch
    completes, the feed is wrapped up and sent to the GSA.  The default
    maxFeedSize is 10MB, and is configurable in applicationContext.xml.

  * Issue 180: Increased the default size of traversal batches from 100
    documents to 500 documents.  This provides improved efficiency in most
    connectors.  The size of traversal batches can now be configured
    by setting the batchSize property of the HostLoadManager bean
    in applicationContext.xml.

  * Fixed a rounding error in the HostLoadManager documents-per-minute
    computation.

  * The Connector Manager now enforces the FileSizeLimitInfo.maxDocumentSize
    configuration property.  This property sets the maximum size of a Document's
    content and is specified in applicationContext.xml.  The default value is
    30 megabytes.  When constructing a document feed, if the number of bytes
    read from the Document's content exceeds the maxDocumentSize, the
    content will be discarded.  The Document's meta-data will be supplied in
    the feed, but its content will not.

    It is still preferable for TraversalContextAware Connector implementations
    to make use of the maxDocumentSize supplied in TraversalContext to avoid
    feeding the content of large documents.  If the Connector knows in advance
    that a Document's content will exceed the maximum size, it can avoid the
    Connector Manager pulling megabytes of data from the Repository, only to
    have it discarded.


Release 2.0.0,  01 June 2009
============================

Introduction
------------
This is an upgrade release with some enhancements.  Users of previous
releases are encouraged to upgrade.  It also contains some new features.
Users of previous releases should check the "Version Compatibility" section
below for instructions on how to use existing data with this new release.

Summary of Changes
------------------
  * Issues 79, 127, 134, 135: Connector Traversal Schedule improvements
       that allow traversals to be disabled, paused, resumed, or to be empty.

  * Issue 94: Enhanced documentation with regards to the meaning of
       a null return value from DocumentList.checkpoint().

  * Issue 107: Connector Instance name added to log messages makes it much
       easier to troubleshoot problems with multiple Connector instances.
       This has deployment configuration issues in manual deployments and
       upgrading existing deployments.  See the Compatibility section below.

  * Issues 111, 119, 142: Infrastructure upgrades to Java 5 language features,
       faster Base64 encoding in feeds, and deployment using Apache
       Tomcat 6.0.18 and Spring Framework 2.5.6.

  * Issue 114: Changes to connectorInstance.xml make it easier to add new
       configuration parameters and to change the default values of existing
       ones in the future, even if a customer has a customized configuration..

  * Issue 122: The Connector's name is now passed to the connector via its
       configuration properties so that connectors may know their own name.

  * Issues 126, 145: Enhanced reliability and error handling in the
       AuthenticationManager and AuthorizationManager.

  * Issue 128: Invalid characters are now either removed or properly quoted
       in the Feed XML attribute values.

  * Issues 131, 148: "Domain" gets preserved when the Connector Manager creates
       an AuthenticationIdentity for the Connector. This has compatibility
       implications for connector writers.  See Compatibility section below.

  * Issues 133, 152: Fixed problems that would corrupt the Connector's
       configuration or leave a partially constructed connector directory
       on disk if an error occurred when creating a new Connector instance.

  * Issues 146, 149: The Connector Manager servlet now has a simple main page
       it may be useful for connectivity test, rather than returning a 404.


Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector authors should note the Issues 131 and 148 changes to the
AuthenticationIdentity Interface, adding the Domain element and getDomain()
method.  The AuthenticationIdentity supplied to the Connector's
AuthenticationManager and the AuthorizationManager.  Older versions
of the Google Search Appliance do not supply the domain, so connectors often
required a configuration setting that specified the Windows domain used.
Connectors that implemented this work-around should continue to do so for the
indefinite future.  However, if the connector received a domain from the GSA,
that domain should be used in deference to any locally configured domain.
For additional details, please see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=131
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=148

The Issue 107 changes provide enhanced logging capabilities that make it
easier to troubleshoot installations with multiple Connector instances.
This feature requires the configuration of a custom log formatter.
The Google Connectors Installer will automatically configure this properly.
However manual installations will require two small changes to enable this
feature:
 - In $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties,
   change the FileHandler.formatter to one of our custom formatters:
   java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter=com.google.enterprise.connector.logging.SimpleFormatter
     or
   java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter=com.google.enterprise.connector.logging.XmlFormatter

 - If $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties
   specifies using the java.util.logging.FileHandler, then you must add the
   new connector-logging.jar file to the system classpath that Tomcat uses at
   startup.  Tomcat ignores the CLASSPATH environment variable and builds a
   custom classpath using the $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/setclasspath.sh or
   $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/setclasspath.bat scripts.  Modify these scripts, adding
   connector-logging.jar to the CLASSPATH constructed: For instance:
   CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH":"$BASEDIR"/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib/connector-logging.jar


Release 1.3.2, Apr 07, 2009
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is an upgrade release that addresses some problems discovered since
the 1.3.0 release.  It also adds some enhanced security measures that
obfuscates configuration data communicated between the Google Search
Appliance and the Connector Manager, and prevents hijacking of a content feed.
These enhanced security measures impact Connector Manager administrators
and Connector Developers.  For details see the Version Compatibility
section below.  Users of previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.

Summary of Changes
------------------
  * Fixed a Concurrency issue with the HostLoadManager.
  * Fix Issue 137: Obfuscate configuration data transported between the
                   Google Search Appliance and the Connector Manager.
                   This has compatibility implications for connector
                   writers.  See the Compatibility section below.
  * Fix Issue 138: Prevent hijacking a Connector Manager Content Feed
                   using a "set once latch".  This makes it difficult to
                   implement man-in-the middle attacks that observes
                   document content as it is being fed to the GSA.
                   Redirecting a content feed now requires manual intervention.
                   This has compatibility implications for Connector Manager
                   administrators.  See the Compatibility section below.
  * Fix Issue 139: A followup change to Issue 137 that corrects a problem
                   filtering forms that have embedded scripts, but no
                   sensitive data.
  * Fix Issue 140: Fix a problem where the GsaFeedConnection did not
                   handle OutOfMemoryErrors correctly, resulting in a
                   loop feeding the same content indefinitely.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
The two security enhancements (Issues 137 and 138) have compatibility
issues for connector authors and administrators.

The Connector Manager now obfuscates the connector configuration form data
sent between the GSA and Connector Manager.  This prevents sensitive
configuration settings (such as ECM account passwords) from being trasmitted
in the clear.  However to accomplish this, the Connector Manager must parse
the configuration form returned by ConnectorType getPopulatedConfigForm(),
getConfigForm(), and validateConfig() methods.  These forms must now be
well-formed XHTML fragments.  For additional details, please see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=137

The Connector Manager now has a latch that prevents redirecting a content
feed without manual intervention by an administrator.  Connector administrators
must now clear a flag in the Connector Manager properties before configuring
the Connector Manager to feed a different Search Appliance.  For details see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=138


Release 1.3.1, Mar 16, 2009
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is an upgrade release that addresses some problems discovered since
the 1.3.0 release.  Users of previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.

Summary of Changes
------------------
  * Fix Issue 110: Multiple threading issues, including a race condition,
                   a deadlock condition, and failures when handling hanging
                   traversers.  This should fix a large number of traversals
                   that stop and never resume.  Some timeouts were lengthened
                   as well, so some long-running tasks should no longer be
                   considered "hung" and are likely to complete successfully.

  * Fix Issue 123: Properties, including passwords, were inadvertently logged.

  * Fix Issue 130: Wrong error messaged displayed if error status is returned
                   from SetConnectorConfig servlet.


Release 1.3.0, Jan 13, 2009
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is an upgrade release with some enhancements.  Users of previous
releases are encouraged to upgrade.  It also contains some new features.  Users
of previous releases should check the "Version Compatibility" section below for
instructions on how to use existing data with this new release.

Summary of Changes
------------------
  * Fix Issue 9:   Miscellaneous minor issues in mock pusher
  * Fix Issue 49:  Connector instance properties are stored before they are validated.
  * Fix Issue 52:  ConnectorFactory interface in the Javadoc is not documented
  * Fix Issue 57:  AuthorizationResponse.equals should use the valid field
  * Fix Issue 58:  site: operator doesn't work with connector feeds
  * Fix Issue 59:  Add a canonical title property
  * Fix Issue 62:  TraversalContextAware interface is not used
  * Fix Issue 72:  Multiple problems with exception handling in QueryTraverser.runBatch
  * Fix Issue 78:  Fix config storage
  * Fix Issue 80:  Implement ConnectorFactory
  * Fix Issue 81:  Encrypt property with 'password' case insensitive
  * Fix Issue 85:  Property accesses are not documented clearly
  * Fix Issue 100: Sending documents with a search url causes exception for smb paths.
  * Fix Issue 102: Tomcat process may not exit on Linux
  * Fix Issue 105: Allow retrieval of CM and/or Connector config by the GSA
  * Fix Issue 108: Fix exception handling in DocPusher
  * Fix Issue 109: Latest svn connector-manager builds (post 1.1) do not set googleworkdir
                   and googleconnectorworkdir in connector.properties file
  * Fix Issue 112: Use PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer for feedLoggingLevel property
  * Fix Issue 116: restartConnectorTraversal is broken


Version Compatibility
---------------------

Connector Names Should Not Contain Upper Case Alphabetics
---------------------------------------------------------
Newer releases of the Google Search Appliance require that
Connector names contain only lower case alphabetic characters.
Numeric digits, dashes, and underscores are still allowed,
with the previously documented limitations, however upper case
alphabetics should no longer be used.  Problems using upper
case characters in Connector names first appeared in GSA
version 5.0.4.G22, showing only minor inconsistencies in
crawl diagnostics.  In GSA version 5.2, search authorizations
fail.

Unfortunately, the new lower case connector name limitation
is not enforced when creating Connectors on the GSA
Connector Administration page.

Connector Manager version 1.3.0 makes small concessions to
this issue.  For instance, new Connectors have their name
lower cased at the time of creation.

The Connector Manager does not, however, change the case
of existing Connectors or migrate existing Connectors to
the new lower case form.  Doing so would lead to inconsistent
search results and make previously indexed content inaccessable.

If you have existing Connector instances with mixed case or
upper case names, you must changed them before upgrading to
GSA version 5.2, or existing content fed from that Connector
will become unsearchable.

Further details and instructions may be found at:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/wiki/LowerCaseConnectorNames


Connector Manager SPI Changes that Affect Connector Implementation
------------------------------------------------------------------
Connectors created using previous 1.0.x and 1.1.0 versions of this
product may not be compatible with this version. There have been
several small changes to the SPI, some additional functionality made
available for the Connectors, and some clarification of flow of control.

The following changes to the Connector Manager may have direct impact on
existing connectors:

ConnectorFactory for use by ConnectorType.validateConfig()
----------------------------------------------------------
The Connector Factory is provided to ConnectorType.validateConfig(),
which may use it to construct Connector instances for the purpose
of validation.  The ConnectorFactory uses the same mechanism to
create the Connector instance that the ConnectorManager uses to
create the "Normal" running instances.  However, the instances
created by the ConnectorFactory are considered transient - they
are not scheduled for traversal or used to authorize search
results.

For additional information see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=80
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/source/browse/trunk/projects/connector-manager/source/java/com/google/enterprise/connector/spi/ConnectorFactory.java
For an example of ConnectorFactory use:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-otex/source/browse/trunk/projects/otex-core/source/java/com/google/enterprise/connector/otex/LivelinkConnectorType.java


ConnectorType.validateConfig() May Return a Modified Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------
ConnectorType.validateConfig() may now return a modified configuration
in the ConfigureResponse if desired.  That modified configuration
will be saved and used to create the running connector instance.

For additional information see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/source/browse/trunk/projects/connector-manager/source/java/com/google/enterprise/connector/spi/ConnectorType.java
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/source/browse/trunk/projects/connector-manager/source/java/com/google/enterprise/connector/spi/ConfigureResponse.java


Exception Handling in TraversalManager, DocumentList, Document, Property, Value
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The handling of Exceptions thrown during document traversal and feeding
has been greatly improved.  In the previous releases, exceptions thrown
during traversal would often result in loops or hangs, usually halting
traversal progress.  Connectors should only ever throw RepositoryExceptions
out of these interfaces, however we now provide a new subclass of
RepositoryException, called RepositoryDocumentException, that is handled
differently.  In short, throwing a RepositoryDocumentException will
force the Connector Manager to skip the document currently being processed,
proceeding to the next one.  Throwing a RepositoryException will instruct
the Connector Manager to abandon the current batch of documents and
retry later.  The Connector must also properly handle a call to
DocumentList.checkpoint() after an exception is thrown.

For more information, see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=72
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=108
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/source/browse/trunk/projects/connector-manager/source/java/com/google/enterprise/connector/spi/DocumentList.java
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/source/browse/trunk/projects/connector-manager/source/java/com/google/enterprise/connector/spi/Document.java


Returning Null DocumentList vs. Empty DocumentList from TraversalManager
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous versions of the Connector Manager handled a null return value
and an empty DocumentList [non-null, but zero items] returned from
TraversalManager.startTraversal() and TraversalManager.resumeTraversal()
identically.  This version of the Connector Manager makes a subtle
differentiation between the two.  A null return value is interpreted
as before: no new content is available for indexing, sleep for a few
minutes and try again.  An returned empty DocumentList is interpreted
differently: although no suitable documents were found yet, the
Connector is performing a rather time-consuming search looking for
appropriate content.  The Connector Manager will call checkpoint()
and reschedule the Connector for an immediate call to resumeTraversal().
This allows the Connector to time-slice or monitor a time-consuming
search for content without running afoul of the Connector Manager
time-out of work threads.  Connectors that return an empty DocumentList,
when they should be returning null, will effectively run in a busy loop.

For more information, see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=72
For an example of a Connector that uses this model, see the
LivelinkTraversalManager.listNodes() method at:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-otex/source/browse/trunk/projects/otex-core/source/java/com/google/enterprise/connector/otex/LivelinkTraversalManager.java


New "google:title" Property
---------------------------
The named link that the GSA presents in search results is usually
a title or headline that the GSA extracts from the document content.
At this time, the GSA does not make use of other metadata supplied
by the Connector to display this title, so if the feed has no content
or the GSA cannot extract a meaningful title from the supplied
content, it instead displays the URL to the document in the search
result.  Unfortunately, the URLs of documents from Connector Feeds
are usually uninformative to the viewer.

The Connector Manager has created a new canonical metadata field,
"google:title", defined as SpiConstants.PROPNAME_TITLE.  At this
point, the GSA makes no special use of this field.  However, if
the Connector Manager receives a metadata and content feed with
no actual "google:content" field, it will create stub content
consisting of an html title fragment.  This causes the current
GSA versions to display that title in the search results.

In the future the GSA may make more direct use of the google:title
field, so even if your Connector does provide content, it should
still present the document name/title/headline/subject as google:title.

For more information see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=59


TraversalContext and TraversalContextAware
------------------------------------------

The Connector Manager now provides a TraversalContext implementation
to Connectors so that they may better determine what types of
document content to provide during a traversal.  Connectors may use
the information provided by the TraversalContext to limit content
provided for indexing, based upon document size or MIME type.

For instance, the Connector might use TraversalContext information to:
 - Provide a Document with metadata and full content.
 - Provide a Document with metadata but supply content in an
   alternate format (such as HTML or PDF).
 - Provide a Document with metadata and summarized content.
 - Provide a Document with metadata but no content.
 - Skip a Document entirely.

If a Connector's TraversalManager implementation adds the
com.google.enterprise.connector.spi.TraversalContextAware interface,
the Connector Manager will then call the setTraversalContext()
method, supplying a TraversalContext for the Connector to use,
before calling any methods in the TraversalManager interface.

If a TraversalContext is provided, the Connector's TraversalManager
may then use it to tailor its Document feed.  For instance, the
TraversalContext could be used to determine whether or not to
supply a "google:content" property for a Document, based upon
the document size or MIME type.  Note that the TraversalContext
interface has changed slightly from its previous (unimplemented)
version.

For additional information, see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/wiki/TraversalContext
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=78


Connector Configuration Storage
-------------------------------

This version of the Connector Manager moves the stored Connector
schedule and traversal state (checkpoint) from the Java Preferences
to files stored in the Connector instance directory (found under
$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/connectors).  This
is the same directory that the Connector's configuration properties
file and optional connectorInstance.xml file is stored.

The presence of these two additional files is unlikely to affect the
Connectors.  The files are named $CONNECTOR_NAME_schedule.txt and
$CONNECTOR_NAME_state.txt, where $CONNECTOR_NAME is the name of the
Connector instance.

For more information, see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=78


Password Encryption with EncryptedPropertyPlaceholderConfigurer
---------------------------------------------------------------
All properties in the Connector's configuration properties file,
whose property key contains the substring "password" (case-insensitive
match) are now encrypted by default.  In the past, only properties
with the key "Password" were encrypted.  Connectors using the
EncryptedPropertyPlaceholderConfigurer are unlikely to notice the
change.

The names of future new configuration properties should be chosen
accordingly.  For instance, this now allows a Connector to maintain
separate passwords for different repository services.  However,
the Livelink Connector configuration now has an encrypted boolean
property, because it happens to contain the substring "password"
in its name.

For more information, see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=81


SMB Search URLs
---------------
Previous versions of the Connector Manager would reject
google:searchurl metadata that used the "smb:" scheme for
the URL.  This has been fixed.

For additional information, see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=100


AuthorizationResponse.equals() and AuthorizationResponse.hashCode()
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The AuthorizationResponse.equals() and AuthorizationResponse.hashCode()
methods have been changed to include the AuthorizationResponse.valid
member in the computations.  In previous versions of the Connector
Manager, only the AuthorizationResponse.docid member was used in
AuthorizationResponse.equals() and AuthorizationResponse.hashCode().
The change is subtle, but AuthorizationResponse instances
{ "1234", true } and { "1234", false } are now considered unequal,
where they would have been considered equal in the past.

For more information, see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/issues/detail?id=57


Release 1.1.0, Jun 30, 2008
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is an upgrade release with some enhancements.  Users of previous
releases are encouraged to upgrade.  It also contains some new features.  Users
of previous releases should check the "Version Compatibility" section below for
instructions on how to use existing data with this new release.
