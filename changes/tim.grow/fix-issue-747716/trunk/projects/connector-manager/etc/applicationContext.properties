# If you set localFeedDir, whenever the connector manager feeds content to the
# GSA, it will write a duplicate copy of the feed XML to a file in the
# directory specified by localFeedDir.
# GSA customers and third-party developers can use this functionality to
# observe the content the connector manager sends to the GSA and reproduce any
# issue which may arise.
