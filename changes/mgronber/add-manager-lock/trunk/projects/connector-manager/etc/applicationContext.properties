# This property is used to lock out the Admin Servlet and prevent it from making
# changes to this configuration file.  Specifically, the ability to set the
# FeedConnection properties will be locked out.  If it is set to 'true' or
# missing the Servlet will not be allowed to update this file.
# NOTE: This property will automatically be changed to 'true' upon successful
# update of the file by the Servlet.  Therefore, once the FeedConnection
# properties are successfully updated by the Servlet subsequent updates will be
# locked out until the flag is manually reset.
manager.locked=false
# This property controls the logging of the feed record to a log file.  The log
# record will contain the feed XML without the content data.  Set this property
# to ALL to enable feed logging, OFF to disable.  Customers and developers can
# use this functionality to observe the feed record and metadata information
# the connector manager sends to the GSA.

# If you set teedFeedFile to the name of an existing file,
# whenever the connector manager feeds content to the GSA, it will write a
# duplicate copy of the feed XML to the file specified by teedFeedFile.
# GSA customers and third-party developers can use this functionality to
# observe the content the connector manager sends to the GSA and reproduce any
# issue which may arise.
