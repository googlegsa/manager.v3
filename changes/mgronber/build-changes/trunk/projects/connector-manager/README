Welcome to the Google Enterprise Connector Manager project!

The Connector Manager is the central part of the connector framework
for Google search appliances. The Connector Manager itself is a server
that manages creation, instantiation, scheduling and monitoring of
connector plug-ins that supply content and provide authentication and
authorization services to the Google Search Appliance. 

Some important disclaimers:

    * This system depends on a future version 5.0 of the Google Search
      Appliance. 
    * Plug-ins developed for this framework will NOT work with
      previously released Google Search Appliances! 
    * Google makes NO commitments at this time to support the APIs in
      this project.
