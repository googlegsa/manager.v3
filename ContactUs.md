Thanks for your interest in the Google Search Appliance Connector Manager!

The Google Search Appliance connector framework enables the Google Search Appliance to search and serve documents stored in non-Web repositories, such as enterprise content management systems. An enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central repository for large numbers of documents.

The Connector Manager is the central part of the connector framework for the Google Search Appliance. The Connector Manager itself manages creation,  scheduling, and monitoring of connectors that supply content and provide authentication and authorization services to the Google Search Appliance.
