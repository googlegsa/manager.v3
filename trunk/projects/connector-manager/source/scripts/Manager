# This helper script is used to access several Connector Manager functions
# from the command line.  This script sets up the Java classpath needed
# by the Connector Manager, then invokes the Connector Manager command
# processor.

# Usage: Manager [-?] [-v] [command] [options] [arguments]
#        -?, --help    Display the set of available commands
#        -v, --version Display the Connector Manager version
#
# To get help for a command, specify the command along with -? or --help
# For instance:
# % Manager MigrateStore --help

# If your Connector requires JAR files not included in the Connector
# installation (for instance Documentum DFC JAR files), then you should
# specify those JAR files in the CLASSPATH environment variable.
# For instance:
# % export CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH":"$DOCUMENTUM_SHARED"/dfc/dfc.jar:"$DOCUMENTUM_SHARED"/config
