rem  This helper script is used to access several Connector Manager functions
rem  from the command line.  This script sets up the Java classpath needed
rem  by the Connector Manager, then invokes the Connector Manager command
rem  processor.
rem
rem  Usage: Manager [-?] [-v] [command] [options] [arguments]
rem         -?, --help    Display the set of available commands
rem         -v, --version Display the Connector Manager version
rem
rem  To get help for a command, specify the command along with -? or --help
rem  For instance:
rem    Manager MigrateStore --help

rem  installation (for instance Documentum DFC JAR files), then you should
