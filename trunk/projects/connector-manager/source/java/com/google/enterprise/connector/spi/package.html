<p>Defines the SPI for connector developers who wish to write
plug-ins to the Google Search Appliance.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>The Connector Manager uses the <a
	href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring Framework</a> to
instantiate two important interfaces of this package: {@link
com.google.enterprise.connector.spi.ConnectorType} and
{@link com.google.enterprise.connector.spi.Connector}. 
The implementor of this SPI must
provide two Spring xml configuration files to notify the Connector
Manager of the existence of their implementation and to describe how to
instantiate their implementation. These two files must have these names:</p>
<ul>
	<li>connectorType.xml</li>
	<li>connectorInstance.xml</li>
</ul>
<p>The first file, connectorType.xml, should be a complete and
independent file that provides a bean definition for a class that
implements the ConnectorType interface. The Connector Manager will use
the id attribute of that bean as the name of your implementation. It is
the implementor's responsibility to make sure that this name is unique
in a Search Appliance installation (that is, unique to all Connector
Managers in an installation).</p>
<p>When a connector manager starts up, it looks for all classpath
resources with this path: config/connectorType.xml. It passes these to
Spring which then instantiates them all. Connector developers should
include such a file in the jar in which they package their connector.</p>
<p>The second file, connectorInstance.xml, should provide a bean
definition for a class that implements the Connector interface. The id
attribute for this bean should be the same as the id for your
ConnectorType interface. Unlike the connectorType.xml, the file is not
normally self-contained. It may refer to external variables in the
following syntax:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;property name="username" value="${username}"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>These variables will be supplied by Spring from a properties file
created by the Connector Manager for each instance of a connector.
Spring supplies these values using their
<a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/index.html">
PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer</a>
functionality. The actual values are
expected to come from the Search Appliance administrator, via screens
rendered on the Administrator Console.</p>
<p>The primary responsibility of the ConnectorType implementation is
to provide the Administrator Console with forms and validation methods
for these configuration screens.</p>
<p>Example: suppose you want to write a connector for a 3rd-party
CMS named "XyzCms". You would write a complete java implementation of
this SPI, using the XyzCms's proprietary API. You would also provide the
two xml files, ConnectorType.xml and ConnectorInstance.xml. You might
give the defined beans in both XML files the ids "XyzCmsConnector" - or
perhaps "XyzCmsConnectorFromMyCompany", to ensure uniqueness.</p>
<p>At a particular customer installation, the Search Appliance
administrator would find a machine on which to run an external Connector
Manager, would download and install Tomcat, then Connector Manager from
the <a
	href="http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/">
code site</a>, or by using simpler, supported installers, if such exist. He
or she would then download and install your connector, according to
directions you supply. When the Connector Manager starts up in the new
Tomcat instance, it looks for all config files on the class path at
"config/connectorType.xml", and it discovers your XyzCmsConnector,
perhaps among others. It uses Spring to instantiate your class that
implements "ConnectorType" according to that XML file.</p>
<p>Suppose that customer has two different XyzCms repositories, with
different names, say "XyzA" and "XyzB". The customer would then use the
Search Appliance's Admin Console to create two instances of your
connector, perhaps giving the connector instances the same names as the
repositories: "XyzA" and "XyzB". In turn, the connector manager would
automatically create two properties files, named after the connector
instance names, XyzA.properties and XyzB.properties.
The connector manager then uses Spring to instantiate two instances of
your Connector implementation, using the two properties files.</p>
