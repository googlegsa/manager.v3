 * Interface for a local copy of a document that is stored on the GSA.

 * serialized entries in the snapshot files (the implementations need
 * not be the same concrete, although doing so is often convenient).
 * <p>
 * The diffing package depends on the ordering of snapshots, which
 * must match the order of their appearance in the
 * {@link SnapshotRepository}. By default the ordering of snapshots is
 * determined by the lexicographic ordering of their document IDs (the
 * natural order of Java {@code String} values).
 * <p>
 * Since version 3.0.6, the {@code DocumentSnapshot} implementation
 * class can also implement {@link Comparable}. The diffing package
 * will check for the {@code Comparable} implementation before
 * comparing the document IDs. Reasons to implement {@code Comparable}
 * to define the details of the ordering include the lexicographic
 * ordering of the document IDs, and the encoding required to make the
 * document IDs safe to use in URLs, which might not be an
 * order-preserving encoding (e.g., Base64 is not order-preserving).
