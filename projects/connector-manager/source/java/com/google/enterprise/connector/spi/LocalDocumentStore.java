/**
 * A local persistent store of information about documents that is managed by
 * the Connector Manager for connectors.
 * <p/>
 * Document metadata is automatically persisted (or deleted) for documents by
 * the Connector Manager:
 * <ul>
 * <li>for documents in {@link DocumentList} objects returned by the connector
 * in response to {@link TraversalManager#startTraversal()} or
 * {@link TraversalManager#resumeTraversal(String)} calls</li>
 * <li>provided the connector explicitly sets the
 * {@link SpiConstants#PROPNAME_MANAGER_SHOULD_PERSIST} property to {@code true}
 * </li>
 * <li>and provided the {@link SpiConstants#PROPNAME_ACTION} property is not set
 * to {@link SpiConstants.ActionType#DELETE} (if it is, then the document is
 * removed from the local store)</li>
 * <li>however, only those metadata items that are keys in the
 * {@link SpiConstants#PERSISTABLE_ATTRIBUTES} map are persisted</li>
 * </ul>
 * In addition, connector implementors may use the
 * {@link #storeDocument(Document)} method to programmatically store a document
 * in the local store without sending it through the traversal manager.
 * <p/>
 * The connector may explicitly request stored information to be returned
 * through the {@link #findDocument(String)}, {@link #getDocumentIterator()} and
 * {@link #getDocumentIterator(String)} calls. These calls return
 * {@link Document} objects; again, only those keys in the
 * {@link SpiConstants#PERSISTABLE_ATTRIBUTES} map will be populated.
 * <p/>
 * If necessary, the connector developer can also get access to the underlying
 * document table in the database implementation of this store by:
 * <ul>
 * <li>getting it's name through the
 * {@link LocalDocumentStore#getDocTableName()} call</li>
 * <li>getting a {@link DataSource} object by calling
 * {@link LocalDatabase#getDataSource()}</li>
 * <li>constructing SQL queries and submitting them through JDBC</li>
 * </ul>
 * The connector implementor should not create records in this table through
 * JDBC.
